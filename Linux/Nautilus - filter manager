== SOLUTION ==

First thing to try is sudo nautilus in a terminal. If it works, then it may mean that there is something wrong with active nautilus processess for your current user.

To be able to restart nautilus properly, do the following:

See what nautilus processes are running :
ps aux | grep nautilus
Kill all nautilus processes you see :
sudo kill PIDNUMBER
Restart nautilus :
nautilus -q
