Apache http server is already included by Fedora distribution, don't need to install it.

1. Put Web folder in /var/www/html

2. Active the service
    sudo service httpd start

3. To allow clients to read static content on the server, we should set the httpd_read_user_content on
    sudo setsebool httpd_read_user_content on
    
   To check
    getsebool httpd_read_user_content


If not
sudo dnf install httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
sudo systemctl start httpd.service
put your site on /var/www/html/
