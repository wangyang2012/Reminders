This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:
  git reset


This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):
  git checkout .

You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:
  git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]

Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):
  git reset --hard HEAD
  
This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:
  git clean -fdx
  WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files!
  
To sum it up: executing commands below is basically equivalent to fresh git clone from original source (but it does not re-download anything, so is much faster):
  git reset
  git checkout .
  git clean -fdx
