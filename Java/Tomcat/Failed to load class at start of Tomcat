After Maven Update in Eclipse, is possible that Tomcat throws NotFoundClassException for Spring, Struts, JSP standard classes. 
It's because Eclipse init Build path options when doing Maven Update operation.

right click on the project 
Build path
Configure build path
Deployment Assembly
Add...
Java Build path entries
Maven Dependencies

It should OK
