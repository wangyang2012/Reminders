After Maven Update in Eclipse, is possible that Tomcat throws NotFoundClassException for Spring, Struts, JSP standard classes. 
It's because Eclipse init Build path options when doing Maven Update operation.

right click on the project 
Build path
Configure build path
Deployment Assembly
Add...
Java Build path entries
Maven Dependencies
It should be OK


At the start of Tomcat, if we use external jar libraries, it's necessary to add libraries in Run Configuration of Tomcat.
In Run Configuration dialog of Tomcat Server
Go to Classpath tab
Add External JARs...
I should be OK
