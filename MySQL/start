********* Disable autostart of MySql *********
-- solution 1 --
Open the terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T
Open the mysql.conf file: nano /etc/init/mysql.conf
Comment out the start on line near the top of the file, the start on might be spread across two lines, so comment out both. (comment adding # at the beginning)
If you want to manually start mysql, use the following command:
service mysql start

-- solution 2 --
sudo systemctl disable mysql
